# Substance

Substance is a web-based technology stack for collaborative document manipulation.

Substance releases all building blocks as Open Source under and MIT license, so you can glue them together for your usecase.

Currently the following modules are available:

- [Substance.Data](http://github.com/substance/data) - A uniform interface to domain data that supports versioning, persistence and replication
- [Substance.Document](http://github.com/substance/document) - A feature-rich and well-tested document model and manipulation API
- [Substance.Surface](http://github.com/substance/surface) - A boilerplate for web-based text editors
- [Substance.Chronicle](http://github.com/substance/chronicle) - A git inspired versioning API based on Operational Transformations (OT)
- [Substance.Operator](http://github.com/substance/operator) - Operational Transformation for strings, arrays and objects.
- [Substance.Library](http://github.com/) - Filing Substance documents
- [Substance.Store](http://github.com/) - Document storage layer

web-based document authoring and publishing engine developed in the open and available to everyone.

The Substance Composer is a desktop application (OSX and Linux first, Windows later), where you create and manage digital documents. While traditional text editors usually deal with visual information (emulating its representations on paper), the Substance Composer is developed around the idea that content is data. Its structured document composition allows documents to be stored and represented in multiple arbitrary ways. On top of that, with its collaborative features you can annotate, comment and revise your content with anyone.
